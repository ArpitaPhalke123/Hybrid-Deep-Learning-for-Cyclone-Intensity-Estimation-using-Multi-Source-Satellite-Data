Hybrid Deep Learning for Cyclone Intensity Estimation using Multi-Source Satellite Data

Introduction:
Cyclones form over warm ocean waters (≥26.5°C) with high humidity and low vertical wind shear.
Rising moist air creates a low-pressure system that rotates due to the Coriolis effect.
Accurately predicting cyclone intensity early is difficult due to unclear storm centers.
Traditional models rely on manual techniques and lack real-time responsiveness.
This project uses multi-source satellite imagery and features like optical flow, cloud asymmetry, and cold cloud top variation.
A hybrid deep learning model (CNN + Transformer) is employed for accurate, real-time cyclone intensity estimation.
